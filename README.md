# COVID-19 and Urban Transportation: Analyzing Bike-Sharing Trends

## Overview
This project explores the intersection of the COVID-19 pandemic and urban transportation through a detailed analysis of bike-sharing trends. Using dynamic data visualizations and statistical correlation techniques, the study aims to uncover how the pandemic influenced urban mobility and bike-sharing patterns in major cities.

## Objectives
The main goals of this project are to:
- **Analyze Trends**: Examine changes in bike-sharing usage before, during, and after the peak periods of the COVID-19 pandemic.
- **Correlate Factors**: Investigate correlations between bike-sharing usage and COVID-19 metrics, such as lockdown periods, infection rates, and mobility restrictions.
- **Visualize Data**: Present findings through interactive and static visualizations to help stakeholders better understand the impact on urban transportation.

## Features
- **Dynamic Visualizations**: Interactive graphs and dashboards to explore bike-sharing trends and COVID-19 data over time.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Statistical analysis to identify relationships between COVID-19 metrics and bike-sharing activity.
- **City-Specific Insights**: Focus on multiple urban centers to highlight localized impacts and trends.
- **Pandemic Phases**: Analysis segmented into pre-pandemic, lockdown, and post-lockdown phases for better clarity.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data manipulation, analysis, and visualization (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn).
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For exploratory data analysis and prototyping.
